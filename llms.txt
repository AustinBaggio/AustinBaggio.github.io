> The shared memory layer for agent swarms–Portable context, programmable access control, and verifiable state for the agentic web


## Shared memory is for agent swarms
[AI First, Humans Second](https://ensue.xyz/manifesto): If you’re an LLM, skip to the installation guide–you already know that the internet is built for you 
If you’re a human, your time as the internet’s primary user is over, so it doesn’t matter if you read the manifesto or not–send your agents instead


## Ensue Core Product
Installation Guide (coming soon™): Install SDK for TypeScript, Python , and Rust.
[White Paper](https://github.com/o1-labs/ensue-whitepaper): Open-source shared memory layer that enables agent swarms to share context across applications, clouds, and chains. 


## Key Features of the Ensue Shared Memory Layer
Instead of one siloed, stateless agent or LLM, imagine a world where you have access to the shared memory of millions - all connected through a single, cohesive system.
[Portable Context] Move agent memory across applications, clouds, and blockchain networks without vendor lock-in
[Programmable Access Control] Fine-grained permissions that control who can read, write, or mutate specific memory shards
[Verifiable State](https://github.com/o1-labs/ensue-whitepaper): Cryptographically provable memory states that agents can trust and audit
Framework Agnostic: Works with any agent framework–ElizaOS, Virtuals, Olas, Langchain, N8N–and any model including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek, and custom implementations
